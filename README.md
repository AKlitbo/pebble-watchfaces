# Pebble Watchfaces

A collection of watchfaces for Pebble smartwatches. These watchfaces display the time, date, weather, heart rate, step count, and battery status, wrapped in various stylized interfaces like LCARS and radar arrays.

## Project Structure

This repository contains multiple watchface variants and the shared library that powers them:

* **`watchfaces/`**: Individual watchface projects.
  * `lcars-stardate-emery`: A standard LCARS themed watchface for the Pebble Time 2 (**Emery**).
  * `radar-array-emery`: A radar-array themed watchface for the Pebble Time 2 (**Emery**).
* **`lib/`**: The shared engine powering all watchfaces.
  * **`c/` & `js/`**: Common device/host code (weather providers, unit conversion, health data, UI components).
  * **`css/`**: Shared CSS stylesheets used across web-based configuration pages and preview frames.
  * **`py/`**: Centralized Python helpers that abstract away the Pebble SDK build boilerplate for all watchfaces.
  * **`resources/`**: Common image assets and icons shared between faces (e.g., weather condition glyphs, connection symbols).
* **`tools/`**: Shared Node.js development utilities for rendering watchface preview frames, rasterizing SVG icons, and generating C resource tables.
* **`vendor/`**: Third-party assets and templates.
